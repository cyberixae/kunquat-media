    NOTE:

Kunquat is in a very early development stage. Don't expect it to do anything
useful.


    Dependencies
    ------------

Building of Kunquat depends on the following tools and libraries:

  scons (http://www.scons.org/)
  libarchive (http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/)
  libwavpack (http://www.wavpack.com/)

In order to get sound you'll need one of the following:

  JACK (http://jackaudio.org/)

  OpenAL (http://www.openal.org/)

Additionally, if you're building the test code, you'll need:

  Check (http://check.sourceforge.net/)
