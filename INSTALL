    NOTE:

Kunquat is in a very early development stage. Don't expect it to do anything
useful.


    Dependencies
    ------------

Building of Kunquat depends on the following tools and libraries:

  scons (http://www.scons.org/)
  liblo (http://liblo.sourceforge.net/)
  libwavpack (http://www.wavpack.com/)

In order to get sound you'll need one of the following:

  JACK (http://jackaudio.org/)
  libao (http://www.xiph.org/ao/) and a sound system supported by it
  ALSA (http://www.alsa-project.org/)

In order to run the old user interface you'll need:

  pyliblo (http://das.nasophon.de/pyliblo/)

Additionally, if you're building the test code, you'll need:

  Check (http://check.sourceforge.net/)
   

    Installing the Dependencies
